tic-tac-toe README
created 09/12/19

Seconds to learn, minutes to master!

created during week 3 of SDI 35
created using HTML, CSS, JavaScript and jQuery.
built from scratch using everything we learned in the first two weeks of our course.
a lot of time was spent achieving the layout I was after and working with CSS and jQuery to create a more dynamic and reactive website.

favourite parts -
the entire project. getting to learn how all the prior learning worked together to create a single cohesive game was very enjoyable.

pain points -
spending too much time on ideas at the start instead of just getting into it and getting it started. a good lesson learned for next time.

wishlist -
themes (dark mode, different colours)
AI (dumb and unbeatable)
local storage

known bugs -
can be same symbol
no input verification for names
no 'first move' prompt for player
not great mobile scaling
